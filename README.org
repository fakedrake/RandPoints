* RandPoints
  This is just a python script that gets a list of players in a game
  mapped to their score and should be able to randomly select one
  based on their points.

** Usage
   Just run:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   python ./randpoints.py input-file.json [output-file.json [result-file.txt]]
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   and the script will output the randomly selected people and
   optionally return an output configuration with the same prizes as
   in the input but with an updated the player list.

   An example input file is this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
   {
    "players": {"mary": 10, "george":1000, "alfonso": 100},
    "prizes": ["gold", "silver", "bronze"],
    "remove_winners": true
   }
   #+END_SRC

   the output will probably be:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ ./randpoints.py players.json output.json
Prize gold goes to george
Prize silver goes to alfonso
Prize bronze goes to mary
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   and the output file (if any) will be

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
   {"players": {}, "remove_winners": true, "prizes": ["gold", "silver", "bronze"]}
   #+END_SRC

   the result file should be something that looks like:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
gold -> george (p: 1000/1110)
silver -> alfonso (p: 100/1110)
bronze -> mary (p: 10/1110)
   #+END_SRC

   The input and output files can be the same file if you want to
   give the same prizes again later to other people.
